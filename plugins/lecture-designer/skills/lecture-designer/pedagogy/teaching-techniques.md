# Teaching Techniques: Evidence-Based Strategies for Engaging Lectures

This guide distills principles from James Lang's *Small Teaching*, Carmine Gallo's *Talk Like TED*, Ken Bain's *What the Best College Teachers Do*, Norman Eng's *Teaching College*, and evidence-based pedagogy research.

## The Science of Attention

### The 18-Minute Rule
Research shows cognitive overload occurs after approximately 18 minutes of continuous information.

**Why it works:**
- Listening is physically exhausting—it depletes glucose at the cellular level
- Information creates "cognitive backlog"—more content = more mental weight
- After 18 minutes, minds begin to shut down

**Solutions:**
- Cap lectures at 18 minutes, OR
- Insert "soft breaks" every 10-15 minutes (stories, activities, videos, movement)
- Chunk content into 3-4 segments with active breaks between

### The Primacy-Recency Effect
Students remember best what happens at the **beginning** and **end** of class.

**Implication:**
- Don't waste the first 5 minutes on administrative announcements
- Don't trail off at the end with "we'll pick this up next time"
- Start strong; end strong

## Opening Techniques (First 5 Minutes)

Student attention is highest at the beginning—use it strategically.

### Six Proven Opening Strategies (Eng)

1. **Provocative Question**
   - Relates to an underlying experience students share
   - "When have you been punished for something you didn't do?"

2. **Striking Statistic or Fact**
   - Surprises and intrigues
   - "Only 20-30% of what you hear in a lecture is retained..."

3. **Anecdote or Personal Story**
   - Most powerful way to connect emotionally
   - "When I was taking accounting, I fell asleep every class..."

4. **Quotation or Aphorism**
   - Provides material for deconstruction
   - "Einstein said 'Imagination is more important than knowledge.' Do you agree?"

5. **Analogy**
   - Simplifies complex concepts
   - "Think of the cell membrane like a nightclub bouncer..."

6. **Scenario or Problem**
   - Puts students in someone's shoes
   - "You're a manager and an employee just filed a complaint against your top performer..."

### Prediction Questions (Lang)
Ask students to predict before revealing content.

**Why it works:**
- Brains are prediction-making machines
- Unsuccessful predictions boost learning more than passive study
- ~10% better performance when making predictions before learning
- Error-induced emotion increases memory retention

**Examples:**
- "What do you think will happen when...?"
- "Before I show you the data, guess the percentage."
- "What would you expect the outcome to be?"

### Prior Knowledge Activation
Ask what students already know before teaching new material.

**Examples:**
- "What do you already know about [topic]?"
- "Write down 3 things you associate with..."
- "Turn to your neighbor and share what you remember about..."

### The ABT Hook (Talk Like TED)
Grab attention with narrative tension:
- **And** (setup): "We know that class sizes are increasing, AND students are distracted..."
- **But** (conflict): "BUT the research shows something surprising..."
- **Therefore** (resolution): "THEREFORE, we need to rethink..."

## During-Lecture Techniques

### Retrieval Practice (The Testing Effect)
Testing isn't just measurement—it's a **learning tool**.

**Why it works:**
- Memory retrieval strengthens long-term retention
- Brain pathways strengthen each time information is retrieved
- Retrieval practice raises performance by a full letter grade

**Key principle:** Students must retrieve from memory—NOT look up answers.

**Quick techniques:**
- "Without looking at your notes, write down the three main points..."
- Unannounced brief quizzes (low-stakes or ungraded)
- "Turn to your neighbor and explain..."
- Pause and ask "What did we just cover?"

### Interleaving
Mix old material with new material (don't concentrate all learning of one topic).

**Why it works:**
- Spaced practice produces better long-term retention than massed practice
- Students initially prefer massed practice, but interleaving works better
- Material that recurs in different contexts "gets well wrought into mental structure"

**Applications:**
- Include questions from previous weeks on quizzes
- Reference back to earlier content while teaching new content
- Mix problem types rather than grouping by type

### Soft Breaks (Every 10-15 Minutes)
Reset attention with:
- Brief video clip (60-90 seconds)
- Poll or clicker question
- Turn-and-talk (30 seconds)
- Stand and stretch
- Quick writing prompt
- Story or anecdote

## Active Learning Techniques

### ConcepTests (Peer Instruction)
Developed by Eric Mazur at Harvard.

**Format:**
1. Present a conceptual question (not calculation)
2. Students vote individually (clickers, hands, cards)
3. If 30-70% correct: students discuss with neighbors
4. Re-vote after discussion
5. Instructor explains correct answer

**Designing good ConcepTests:**
- Stem describes a situation
- Answers are *mechanisms*, not vocabulary
- Distractors represent top 3 wrong mental models
- Target 30-70% correct on first vote (too easy or hard doesn't work)

### Think-Pair-Share
1. **Think**: Individual reflection (30 seconds - 1 minute)
2. **Pair**: Discuss with neighbor (1-2 minutes)
3. **Share**: Report to full class (2-3 minutes)

**Benefits:**
- Everyone thinks (not just volunteers)
- Low-stakes practice before public speaking
- Reveals common misconceptions

### Minute Papers
At end of class, students write briefly:
- "What was the most important thing you learned today?"
- "What question do you still have?"
- "What was the muddiest point?"

**Why it works:**
- Forces synthesis and retrieval
- Provides immediate feedback to instructor
- Only takes 2-3 minutes

## Closing Techniques (Final 5 Minutes)

### 1. Retrieval Summary
Ask students to write (without notes) the 3 most important points.

### 2. Closing Predictions
"What do you think we'll cover next class?"
"Based on today, what do you predict will happen in the case study?"

### 3. The Callback
Return to the opening hook/mystery and resolve it.

### 4. The One Thing
"If you remember ONE thing from today, it should be..."

### 5. Connection Prompt
"How does today's content connect to...?"
- Your own life/experience
- Previous course material
- Current events

## The Rule of Three

Human memory holds 3 pieces of information very well; more drops retention significantly.

**Applications:**
- Organize content into exactly 3 main points
- Provide 3 examples per concept
- Give 3 pieces of evidence
- List 3 implications

**The Message Map:**
```
        [Core Message - One Sentence]
               /        |        \
          Point 1    Point 2    Point 3
          /    \     /    \     /    \
      Ex 1  Ex 2  Ex 1  Ex 2  Ex 1  Ex 2
```

## Storytelling Techniques

### Why Stories Work (Neuroscience)
- Stories cause brains of speaker and listener to sync (neural coupling)
- Stories activate multiple brain regions (language, sensory, visual, motor)
- 63% of people recall stories; only 5% recall statistics

### The 65/25/10 Formula (Bryan Stevenson)
Top TED talks break down as:
- **65%** Pathos (stories, emotional appeals)
- **25%** Logos (data, evidence)
- **10%** Ethos (credibility establishment)

### Three Types of Effective Stories

1. **Personal Stories**
   - Your own experience with the concept
   - Genuine and relatable
   - Include sensory details

2. **Stories About Others**
   - Historical figures
   - Research subjects
   - Case studies

3. **Application Stories**
   - "Imagine you're a manager who..."
   - Hypothetical scenarios
   - "What would you do if..."

### Story Structure
- **Setup**: Establish context, characters, stakes
- **Conflict**: The problem, tension, challenge
- **Resolution**: How it was solved, what was learned

## Making Content Stick (SUCCESs Framework)

From Chip and Dan Heath's *Made to Stick*:

| Element | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Simple** | Find the core; strip to essentials | "It's the economy, stupid" |
| **Unexpected** | Violate expectations; create curiosity | Counter-intuitive findings |
| **Concrete** | Use specific examples, not abstractions | Real cases, not hypotheticals |
| **Credible** | Verifiable sources and evidence | "Research by X showed..." |
| **Emotional** | Make them feel something | Human stories, stakes |
| **Stories** | Narrative structure | Beginning, middle, end |

## Building Belonging and Connection

### Why It Matters
Students learn better when they feel they belong in the classroom community.

### Techniques
- Learn and use student names
- Create low-stakes opportunities for participation early
- Acknowledge diverse perspectives and experiences
- Frame challenges as normal, not signs of inadequacy
- Use asset-based language (what students bring, not what they lack)
- Celebrate effort and improvement, not just outcomes

---

## Emotional Engagement

### Why Emotion Matters
- Emotions enhance learning and memory retention
- Emotional investment in predictions increases retention
- Passion is contagious—literally (neuroscience)

### Techniques
- Show your own enthusiasm for the material
- Share what surprised YOU about the findings
- Connect content to things students care about
- Use appropriate humor (self-deprecating works well)
- Tell stories that evoke emotion
- Celebrate discoveries and insights

## Quick Wins (5-Minute Techniques)

These can be used immediately with no preparation:

1. **Opening prediction**: "Before I show you, guess..."
2. **Prior knowledge dump**: "Write 3 things you know about..."
3. **Pause for retrieval**: Stop and ask what was just covered
4. **Think-Pair-Share**: Any question + neighbor discussion
5. **Muddiest point**: "What's still confusing?"
6. **One-sentence summary**: "Summarize today in one sentence"
7. **Connection moment**: "How does this relate to your life?"
8. **Closing prediction**: "What do you think happens next?"

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Better Approach |
|---------|-----------------|
| Starting with announcements | Start with the hook; save logistics |
| Lecturing without breaks | Insert soft breaks every 10-15 minutes |
| Asking "Any questions?" | Ask specific retrieval questions |
| Letting class fizzle out | Save strong content for end; close intentionally |
| Covering content without application | Include practice at the exact skill assessed |
| Assuming students see connections | Explicitly prompt for connections |
| Testing only at exams | Use frequent low-stakes retrieval |

## Nine "Touches" for Engagement (Eng)

Following marketing principles, students need multiple ways to engage with information:

| Touch | Description | Best For |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Discussion** | Open-ended, interspersed throughout | Exploring perspectives |
| **Debate** | Four-corners format; assign opposing views | Broadening perspective |
| **Small Groups** | 4-5 students problem-solving | Collaborative learning |
| **Surveys/Inventories** | Self-discovery tools | Making topics personal |
| **Role-Play** | Act out scenarios + debrief | Experiencing concepts |
| **Demonstration** | Predict-experience-reflect | Revealing misconceptions |
| **Student Presentations** | Peer teaching (structured) | Deepening understanding |
| **Case Studies** | Real-world problem-solving | Application practice |
| **Guest Speakers** | Experts with credibility | Real-world connection |

## What the Best Teachers Do (Bain)

Ken Bain studied exceptional college teachers for 15 years. Key findings:

### The Fundamental Question Shift
Less effective teachers ask: "What will I cover today?"
Best teachers ask: "What do I want students to be able to DO by the end?"

### Creating a Natural Critical Learning Environment
The best teachers create conditions where students:
- Face intriguing, important problems
- Have genuine choice and input
- Work collaboratively
- Receive non-judgmental feedback
- Can fail safely before high-stakes assessment

### How They Treat Students
- **Trust**: Believe students want to learn and can learn
- **Investment**: Focus on helping students succeed, not displaying brilliance
- **Humility**: Share their own struggles and learning journey
- **Safety**: Create environments where no question is stupid

### Lecture Excellence (Bain)
When lecturing, the best teachers:
- Treat lectures as conversation, not performance
- Move around the room; avoid podiums
- Change pace every 10-12 minutes
- Ask rhetorical questions and wait for response
- Watch student body language and adjust
- Use "warm language" that tells the complete story

### Warm Language (Feynman Principle)
- Tell the complete story from the beginning
- Work forward step-by-step
- Keep language present-tense and involving
- Begin with simple generalizations, add complexity
- Use familiar language before specialized vocabulary
- Employ metaphors and analogies first

### Self-Assessment
All the best teachers:
- Collect ongoing feedback from students
- Videotape themselves and review
- Remain open to change
- Never assume their teaching is optimal

## The Curse of Knowledge

Once you master something, you forget how hard it was to learn.

**Symptoms:**
- Using jargon students don't know
- Assuming connections are obvious
- Moving too fast through "basic" material
- Not understanding why students are confused

**Solutions:**
- Always activate prior knowledge first
- Use think-aloud to model your reasoning
- Ask students to explain in their own words
- Check for understanding frequently

---

## Key Principles Summary

1. **Retrieval > Review**: Testing IS learning
2. **Predict before reveal**: Activate prior knowledge first
3. **Interleave content**: Mix old and new
4. **Chunk + Break**: 15-minute segments with resets
5. **Stories stick**: Lead with narrative, support with data
6. **Three is magic**: Organize around 3 main points
7. **Emotion enhances**: Show passion; create stakes
8. **Practice the skill**: In-class practice with feedback
9. **Belong to learn**: Build community and connection
10. **Small = powerful**: 5-minute interventions compound
11. **Ask better questions**: "What can they DO?" not "What will I cover?"
12. **Trust students**: Believe they can and want to learn
