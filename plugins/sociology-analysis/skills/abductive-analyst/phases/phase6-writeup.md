# Phase 6: Writing Up for Publication

You are executing Phase 6 of an abductive analysis. Your goal is to help the user write up their findings for a journal article using **rhetorical abduction** - structuring the text to convey the data-theory surprise effectively.

## Core Principle: Writing IS Analysis

As Timmermans & Tavory emphasize: "Writing is not a mop-up chore at the end of a research project." The act of writing will reveal whether your surprises are actually surprising, whether your theoretical contribution holds together, and may prompt additional analytical cycles.

## Rhetorical Abduction

Structure the article to mirror the logic of abductive inference:

1. **What we knew/thought we knew** - Establish theoretical expectations
2. **The surprise** - Present data that doesn't fit those expectations
3. **The new theorization** - Your contribution that explains the surprise

This follows the classic narrative arc: **set-up → conflict → resolution** - but for theory.

## Article Structure for Abductive Analysis

### Abstract (~150-250 words)
- State the puzzle or gap in existing theory
- Preview the surprising finding
- Articulate the theoretical contribution
- Keep it compelling - this determines whether people read further

### Introduction (~1000-1500 words)
**Open with a hook** - an evocative empirical moment, a puzzle, or a striking finding that draws readers in

**Establish the theoretical problem:**
- What does existing theory predict or assume?
- What puzzle or gap exists in the literature?
- Why does this matter?

**Preview the argument:**
- What did you find that's surprising?
- What's your theoretical contribution?
- How does this change how we think about the phenomenon?

**Roadmap** (optional, brief) - what's coming in each section

### Literature Review / Theoretical Background (~1500-2500 words)
**Prime the reader's expectations:**
- Review existing theories relevant to your phenomenon
- Show what these theories predict you should find
- Identify tensions, gaps, or limitations in current understanding

**Set up the surprise:**
- By the end of this section, readers should have clear expectations
- These expectations will be disrupted by your findings

**Connect to your contribution:**
- Hint at where the literature falls short
- Prepare readers for why your findings matter

### Data and Methods (~1000-1500 words)
- Describe your data (ACT UP Oral History Project - 187 interviews, etc.)
- Explain your analytical approach (abductive analysis per Timmermans & Tavory)
- Discuss sampling strategy and its rationale
- Address limitations honestly (retrospective accounts, survivor bias, etc.)
- Establish credibility without over-claiming

### Findings (~3000-4000 words)
**This is the heart of abductive writing.**

**Start with the index case:**
- Select your most luminous, evocative empirical example
- This should crystallize the pattern you've found
- Present it in enough detail to be compelling

**Use juxtaposition:**
- Show what theory predicted vs. what you found
- "Standard accounts suggest X, but participants describe Y"
- Let the tension drive the narrative

**Build through variation:**
- Show the pattern across multiple cases
- Include variation - don't flatten into one story
- Use negative cases productively (they refine the argument)

**Select exemplars ruthlessly:**
- You have hundreds of pages of data; you can use maybe 3 pages of quotes
- Choose quotes that do theoretical work, not just illustration
- Each quote should advance the argument

**Structure options:**
- Thematic: organize by key findings/concepts
- Comparative: organize by types of participants or pathways
- Processual: organize by stages or phases
- Puzzle-driven: organize around resolving the theoretical puzzle

### Discussion (~1500-2000 words)
**Articulate the theoretical contribution:**
- What's new here? What should scholars think differently?
- Connect back to the literature - how does this extend, modify, or challenge existing theory?
- Be specific about the contribution (don't just say "this complicates our understanding")

**Specify scope conditions:**
- When does your theory apply? When might it not?
- What's specific to ACT UP vs. generalizable to other movements?

**Address alternative explanations:**
- Anticipate reviewer objections
- Show you've considered other interpretations

**Implications:**
- For theory in your field
- For related fields (if applicable)
- For future research

### Conclusion (~500-750 words)
- Restate the core contribution concisely
- End with broader significance or implications
- Consider ending with an evocative empirical moment that encapsulates your argument

## On Terminology

From Timmermans & Tavory:

**Default to existing vocabulary** - "If you can stick to the existing vocabulary, this is probably better for everyone."

**But if you need a new term:**
- It should "capture something or work out a puzzle that has stumped others"
- Best terms convey meaning without requiring explanation
- Avoid jargon, neologisms, academese
- Test: Does the term do real analytical work, or just rename something?

**Metaphors matter:**
- Fresh imagery > worn-down metaphors
- Your conceptual language should support your analytical points
- Consider what your terminology implies about agency, process, structure

## Practical Guidance

### Selecting Quotes
- Choose the ONE quote that makes the point best
- If you have three quotes that say the same thing, use one
- Edit for length but preserve meaning (and hesitations/pauses if analytically relevant)
- Each quote should do theoretical work

### Word Limits
Typical qualitative article: 8,000-12,000 words total
- After introduction, lit review, methods, and conclusion: ~4,000-5,000 words for findings
- This is NOT much space - be ruthless

### Anticipating Reviewers
- Reviewer 2 will find holes - anticipate and address them
- Show you've considered alternative interpretations
- Don't overclaim - specify scope conditions
- Make the contribution crystal clear

### The "So What?" Test
At every point, ask: Why does this matter?
- Why should readers care about this finding?
- What does it change about how we understand the phenomenon?
- What would be lost if this paper didn't exist?

## Your Tasks

### 1. Review All Prior Phase Outputs
Read through:
- Phase 0: Theoretical map, sensitizing questions
- Phase 1: Interview summaries, codebook, surprises
- Phase 3: Anomalies, contradictions, variation
- Phase 4: Analytical memos, theoretical propositions
- Phase 5: Integrated synthesis, contribution statement

### 2. Identify the Core Argument
- What is THE main theoretical contribution?
- What is THE central surprise that drives the article?
- Can you state it in 1-2 sentences?

### 3. Select Empirical Material
- Choose the index case (most luminous example)
- Select 3-5 additional exemplars that show variation
- Identify quotes that do theoretical work
- Note negative cases that refine the argument

### 4. Draft Article Sections
Create drafts of each section following the structure above:
- Abstract
- Introduction (with hook)
- Literature review (priming expectations)
- Methods
- Findings (using juxtaposition and variation)
- Discussion (articulating contribution)
- Conclusion

### 5. Self-Review
Before presenting to user:
- Does the surprise actually surprise?
- Is the contribution clear and specific?
- Does every quote advance the argument?
- Have you anticipated reviewer objections?
- Is it too long? (It's probably too long - cut more)

## Output Files

Save all outputs to `/analysis/phase6-reports/`:

1. **article-outline.md** - Detailed outline with section-by-section plan
2. **selected-evidence.md** - Curated quotes and exemplars with annotations on their theoretical work
3. **article-draft.md** - Full draft of the article
4. **contribution-statement.md** - Clear 1-page statement of the theoretical contribution
5. **phase6-report.md** - Summary for user including:
   - Core argument
   - Key choices made
   - Areas needing user input
   - Potential reviewer concerns to address

## Model Recommendation

**Use Opus for Phase 6** - This phase requires sophisticated judgment about theoretical contribution, rhetorical structure, and persuasive writing. It's high-stakes creative work.

## Remember

- Writing reveals whether your analysis holds together
- Be prepared to go back and revise earlier phases based on what writing reveals
- Your loyalty is to readers - make choices that serve clarity
- Less is more - a focused argument beats comprehensive coverage
- The goal is to change how readers think about the phenomenon
