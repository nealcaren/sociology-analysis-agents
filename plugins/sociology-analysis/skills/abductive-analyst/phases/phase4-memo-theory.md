# Phase 4: Memo Writing & Theory Development

You are executing Phase 4 of an abductive analysis. Your goal is to develop tentative theoretical propositions through intensive memo writing, moving from documented anomalies toward novel theoretical claims.

## The Logic of Theory Development in Abductive Analysis

Abduction asks: "What would have to be true for these observations to make sense?" Phase 4 takes the anomalies, contradictions, and patterns from Phase 3 and develops theoretical explanations that could account for them.

Key principles:
- Theory should explain the ANOMALIES, not just the patterns
- New concepts may be needed—don't just apply existing frameworks
- Claims should be falsifiable and specify their conditions
- The goal is theoretical innovation, not just description

## Inputs

Before starting, read ALL prior phase outputs:
1. `/analysis/phase1-reports/` - Initial codes and surprises
2. `/analysis/phase2-reports/` - Theoretical casings and gaps
3. `/analysis/phase3-reports/` - Anomalies, contradictions, variation
4. `/theory/` - User-provided theoretical resources
5. Original interviews in `/interviews/` as needed

## Your Tasks

### 1. Identify Core Puzzles

From Phase 3, distill 2-4 core puzzles that need theoretical explanation:
- What are the central anomalies that existing theory doesn't explain?
- What contradictions are most theoretically productive?
- What variation most demands explanation?
- **Prioritize "stubborn variation"** - cases where same structural position led to opposite outcomes

For each puzzle:
- State it clearly and precisely
- Explain why existing frameworks don't adequately address it
- Articulate what a good explanation would need to accomplish

### 1b. Apply Peirce's Abductive Syllogism

**For each Core Puzzle, you MUST attempt to write a proposition using Peirce's Abductive Syllogism:**

```
The Surprising Fact: [State the anomaly from Phase 3]

The Missing Rule: If [New Theoretical Proposition X] were true,
                  then this anomaly would be a matter of course.

The Inference: Therefore, there is reason to suspect
               [New Theoretical Proposition X] is true.
```

**Example:**
```
The Surprising Fact: Iris Long, a straight woman with no prior activist
experience, became the founder of ACT UP's most technically sophisticated
committee (Treatment & Data).

The Missing Rule: If "caregiving experience functions as invisible activist
training that teaches skills in challenging institutional authority," then
Long's pathway would be a matter of course—her years caring for sick family
members prepared her for exactly this work.

The Inference: Therefore, there is reason to suspect that caregiving
experience functions as invisible activist training.
```

This syllogistic form forces you to articulate what NEW theoretical claim would make the anomaly expected rather than surprising. This is the core logic of abductive inference.

### 2. Write Analytical Memos

Write intensive analytical memos exploring possible explanations.

**Memo types to produce**:

**Concept Memos**: Develop new concepts or refine existing ones
- What is the phenomenon being named?
- How is it defined? What are its boundaries?
- How does it differ from existing concepts?
- What does naming it this way highlight?

**Process Memos**: Theorize mechanisms and sequences
- What process connects A to B?
- What are the stages or phases?
- What conditions enable or constrain the process?
- What produces variation in outcomes?

**Relationship Memos**: Theorize connections between concepts
- How do X and Y relate?
- Is it causal? Constitutive? Contingent?
- Under what conditions does the relationship hold?
- What mediates or moderates it?

**Integration Memos**: Connect emerging insights
- How do the pieces fit together?
- What is the overall theoretical argument?
- What is the scope of the theory?

### 3. Develop Theoretical Propositions

From the memos, articulate explicit theoretical claims:

**Format for each proposition**:
- **Claim**: State the proposition clearly
- **Mechanism**: What explains why this is true?
- **Conditions**: Under what circumstances does this hold?
- **Evidence**: What data supports this claim?
- **Counter-evidence**: What data complicates or challenges it?
- **Implications**: What else would be true if this claim is correct?

Aim for 4-8 interconnected propositions that together address the core puzzles.

### 4. Specify Novelty

Articulate what is NEW in the emerging theory:
- What does this framework explain that existing theories don't?
- What new concepts are introduced?
- What existing concepts are modified or combined in new ways?
- What is the theoretical contribution?

Be specific: "This framework extends X by adding Y" or "This concept fills a gap between A and B by capturing C."

### 5. Identify Vulnerabilities

For each theoretical claim, identify:
- What evidence would disconfirm it?
- What alternative explanations exist?
- What are the boundary conditions?
- What assumptions does it rest on?

This prepares for Phase 5 testing.

### 6. Connect to Literature

Locate the emerging theory in relation to existing work:
- What conversations does this contribute to?
- Which scholars is this in dialogue with?
- Where does it confirm existing theory? Extend it? Challenge it?
- What subfield(s) would find this relevant?

## Output Files to Create

Save all outputs to `/analysis/phase4-reports/`:

1. **core-puzzles.md** - The central puzzles requiring explanation
2. **concept-memos/** folder with individual memo files:
   - `memo-[concept1].md`
   - `memo-[concept2].md`
   - etc.
3. **process-memos/** folder with process memos
4. **relationship-memos/** folder with relationship memos

8. **phase4-report.md** - Executive summary including:
   - The core puzzles being addressed
   - Key concepts developed
   - Central theoretical propositions
   - Statement of theoretical novelty
   - Known vulnerabilities to test in Phase 5
   - Questions for the user

Also save key memos to `/analysis/memos/` for cross-phase reference.

## Example Analytical Memo Format

```markdown
# Memo: [Concept/Process/Relationship Name]

**Date**: [Date]
**Type**: Concept Memo / Process Memo / Relationship Memo

## The Puzzle
[What anomaly or question prompted this memo?]

## Working Definition
[If concept memo: current working definition of the concept]
[If process memo: description of the process/mechanism]
[If relationship memo: statement of the relationship]

## Evidence From Data

**Supporting excerpts**:
> "Quote 1" - Participant X (Interview N)

> "Quote 2" - Participant Y (Interview M)

**How these support the concept/process/relationship**:
[Analysis]

## Relationship to Existing Theory
[How does this relate to existing frameworks? Where does it depart?]

## Remaining Questions
- [Question 1]
- [Question 2]

## Connections to Other Memos
- Links to [Memo X] because...
- Tension with [Memo Y] regarding...

## Implications
If this concept/process/relationship holds, then:
- Implication 1
- Implication 2
```

## Example Theoretical Proposition Format

```markdown
## Proposition 3: [Title]

**Claim**: [Clear statement of the theoretical claim]

**Mechanism**: [Why/how does this work?]

**Conditions**: This relationship holds when [conditions]. It may not hold when [other conditions].

**Supporting Evidence**:
- Interviews 3, 7, 12 show that...
- The variation analysis (Phase 3) demonstrated that...

**Complicating Evidence**:
- Interview 9 presents a potential negative case because...
- This claim doesn't fully account for...

**If True, Then**:
- We would also expect to find [X]
- This would mean that existing theory Y needs modification regarding...
- Future research should examine [Z]

**Alternative Explanations**:
- This pattern could also be explained by [alternative 1]
- Another possibility is [alternative 2]
- Phase 5 should test between these alternatives by looking for [specific evidence]
```

## Guiding Principles

1. **Theorize the anomalies**: The value of abductive analysis is explaining what other frameworks miss. Don't just redescribe existing theory.

2. **Name things precisely**: Good theory involves precise concepts. If you need a new concept, define it carefully.

3. **Specify mechanisms**: Don't just say X relates to Y. Explain HOW and WHY.

4. **Embrace tentativeness**: These are working propositions to be tested, not final claims.

5. **Stay grounded in data**: Every theoretical claim should connect to specific interview evidence.

6. **Seek parsimony**: A simpler explanation that accounts for the anomalies is better than a complex one.

7. **Intellectual honesty**: Name the weaknesses. What would prove this wrong?
