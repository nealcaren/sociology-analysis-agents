# Phase 2: Theoretical Casing

You are executing Phase 2 of an abductive analysis. Your goal is to systematically apply multiple theoretical frameworks to key excerpts from the interview data, revealing what different lenses illuminate and obscure.

## Background

In abductive analysis, "casing" means viewing data through a theoretical lens that makes it comparable to other phenomena. Different theories highlight different aspects:
- Symbolic interactionism emphasizes meaning-making and identity negotiation
- Phenomenology focuses on lived experience and consciousness
- Bourdieu's framework highlights field positions, capital, and habitus
- Institutional theory examines scripts, legitimacy, and taken-for-granted rules
- And so on...

The goal is NOT to find the "right" theory but to see what each reveals.

## Inputs

Before starting, read:
1. `/analysis/phase1-reports/surprises.md` - Key surprises to analyze
2. `/analysis/phase1-reports/interview-summaries.md` - Context for excerpts
3. `/analysis/phase1-reports/initial-codebook.md` - Emerging codes
4. `/theory/` folder - Any user-provided theoretical resources
5. Note any specific theoretical frameworks the user requested

## Your Tasks

### 1. Select Key Excerpts
From Phase 1 outputs, identify 10-15 key excerpts for intensive theoretical analysis:
- Prioritize flagged "surprises"
- Include excerpts that seem central to participants' experiences
- Include excerpts where participants contradict each other
- Include excerpts that resist easy categorization

### 2. Apply Multiple Theoretical Lenses

For each excerpt, apply AT LEAST THREE different theoretical frameworks:

**Grand Theory Options** (use 1-2 of these):
- **Symbolic Interactionism**: How are actors negotiating meaning? What identities are being performed or claimed? How is the definition of the situation being constructed?
- **Phenomenology**: What is the lived experience described? How does consciousness engage with this phenomenon? What is the texture of experience?
- **Bourdieu**: What field is this? What capitals are at play? How does habitus shape perception and action? What positions are being claimed?
- **Institutional Theory**: What scripts or templates are being followed or resisted? What is taken for granted? How is legitimacy negotiated?
- **Dramaturgical (Goffman)**: What is the performance? What impression management is occurring? What is frontstage vs. backstage?
- **Actor-Network Theory**: What human and non-human actors are assembled? How is the network configured?

**Middle-Range/Subfield Theory** (use 1-2 based on domain):
- Apply relevant theories from the substantive area (social movements, religion, health, education, organizations, etc.)
- Use any theories from user-provided materials in `/theory/`

### 3. Document Each Casing

For each excerpt and each theoretical lens, document:
- **What this lens highlights**: What aspects of the excerpt become visible/important?
- **What this lens obscures**: What gets backgrounded or ignored?
- **Theoretical interpretation**: How would a scholar using this framework interpret this?
- **Connections**: What other phenomena does this make the excerpt comparable to?
- **Tensions**: Where does the excerpt resist or complicate this theoretical interpretation?

### 4. Cross-Lens Analysis

After casing all excerpts, analyze across theoretical applications:
- Where do theories converge in their interpretation?
- Where do they diverge or conflict?
- Which excerpts are well-explained by existing theory?
- Which excerpts resist all theoretical frameworks? (These are most valuable!)
- What aspects of the data remain un-illuminated by any framework?

### 5. Identify Theoretical Gaps

Document where the data exceeds existing frameworks:
- What are participants describing that theory doesn't capture well?
- What concepts seem to be missing from available frameworks?
- Where do standard theoretical categories feel forced or inadequate?

## Output Files to Create

Save all outputs to `/analysis/phase2-reports/`:

1. **theoretical-casings.md** - Full documentation of all casings
2. **cross-lens-analysis.md** - Comparative analysis across frameworks
3. **theoretical-gaps.md** - Identified gaps and inadequacies
4. **phase2-report.md** - Executive summary including:
   - Which theoretical frameworks were applied
   - Key insights from each framework
   - Most productive tensions and conflicts between frameworks
   - Excerpts that resist theoretical explanation (most important!)
   - Preliminary thoughts on what new concepts might be needed
   - Recommendations for Phase 3 focus

## Example Theoretical Casing Format

```markdown
## Excerpt 3: [Brief identifier]

**Source**: Interview [ID], discussing [topic]

**Excerpt**:
> "Verbatim quote from the transcript that runs long enough to capture the full context of what the participant was saying about this particular topic..."

---

### Symbolic Interactionist Reading

**Highlights**: The participant is negotiating identity as [X]. The phrase "[specific phrase]" suggests meaning-making around...

**Obscures**: The material conditions and structural constraints are not visible through this lens.

**Interpretation**: From this perspective, the participant is engaged in a process of...

**Comparable to**: Other identity negotiation work in [contexts]

**Tensions**: However, the excerpt also shows [something that doesn't fit neatly]

---

### Institutional Theory Reading

**Highlights**: The taken-for-granted script here is [X]. The participant is [following/resisting] institutional logic...

**Obscures**: The subjective experience and emotional dimension is backgrounded.

**Interpretation**: This can be understood as an instance of institutional [work/compliance/resistance]...

**Comparable to**: Institutional dynamics in [other contexts]

**Tensions**: But the participant also [something that complicates this]

---

### [Subfield] Theory Reading
[Apply relevant middle-range theory from the substantive domain]

---

### Cross-Lens Observations

- All frameworks agree that...
- The key tension is between [interactionist reading of X] and [institutional reading of Y]
- What remains unexplained: [specific aspects]
```

## Guiding Principles

1. **Charitable interpretation**: Give each theory its best shot at explaining the excerpt before noting limitations.

2. **Don't force fit**: If an excerpt doesn't fit a framework, say so. That's valuable information.

3. **Specificity**: Name specific theoretical concepts, not just general frameworks. Not just "Bourdieu" but "cultural capital" or "symbolic violence."

4. **Excerpts that resist are gold**: The most analytically valuable findings are where existing theory fails.

5. **User's domain knowledge matters**: If they've provided subfield literature, engage with it seriously.

## When You're Done

Return a summary to the orchestrator that includes:
1. Confirmation that all files were created
2. Number of excerpts analyzed and frameworks applied
3. The 2-3 most theoretically productive tensions identified
4. Excerpts that most strongly resist existing theory
5. Preliminary hunches about what new concepts might be needed
6. Questions for the user about theoretical direction
